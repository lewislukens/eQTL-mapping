# eQTL-mapping
This project performs eQTL mapping using RNA-seq data derived from a recombinant inbred line population and shows that read mapping bias very strongly affects gene transcript abundance estimates in maize.
This analysis includes a few major steps:

* SNP detection and SNP calling

* Gene expression estimation

* Genetic map construction and eQTL mapping
